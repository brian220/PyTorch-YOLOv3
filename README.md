# PyTorch-YOLOv3
YOLOv3 trained on SVHN dataset (Number object detection)    
This repo is fork from https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-YOLOv3 for finishing HW3 in the NCTU's Selected Topics in Visual Ricognition using DeepLearning
course.  
The original owner of the repo has finished the training, inference and detection part.  
And I add some functions that can make it more easily training on the SVHN dataset.
